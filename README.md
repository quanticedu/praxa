# Praxa

This repo stores the shell of a Google Colab notebook for the Praxa app, which students will build in the "LLM-Based Apps" course. To use this, navigate to Praxa_Template.ipynb in the main branch of the repo, then select "Open in Colab". You can then save the notebook to your Google drive (or anywhere else you like).

If you need to get the complete code at any point in the course, select the appropriate branch and navigate to the .ipynb file. Note that you'll have to run all the commands from the beginning to get the runtime environment set up correctly.
